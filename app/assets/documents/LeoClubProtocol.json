Therefore, when inviting special guests, it is not appropriate to invite the District President in any other capacity other than Chief Guest if District Governor is not present on the occasion.</p> <p>This is because at any Leo forum, elected officers of the Leo movement gets precedence over appointed officers. Feel free to contact District President or Immediate Past District President in order to work out protocol to suit your specific function.</p>"
